# Legacy Date/Time Form Fields Module

## Introduction

This module provides a legacy codebase for certain form fields,
which have seen a major refactoring in SilverStripe 2.4.0.

See http://open.silverstripe.org/changeset/99360 for details on what changed.
Most of the features have been retained in some form in sapphire core,
but have different APIs. 

Development and bugfixing on date/time form fields will mainly continue in sapphire core,
this module is unlikely to see much further development. We encourage you to
port any existing customizations and dependencies to the new sapphire core APIs.

## Requirements

 * SilverStripe 2.4.0 beta2 or newer
